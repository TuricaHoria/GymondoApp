# GymondoApp



I tried doing as much as possible but I had a lot of work and I got stuck in several places :
I couldn't get the scroll going , I sincerly don't know why.
For the search I tried both SearchView and EditText but couldn't make it work.



On how to solve the other problems:

For the equipment,muscles,etc I should put them all in MutableLists and bundle them to Deatiled fragment and just get by id which is which.
On the filtering using body parts , I think an easy way is to do it is to modify the endpoint and filter by doing another request ,but that is not that practical.
For the API error , I supose is just when I dont get status 200 , I catch the error (while doing the fetching on the server) and show a dialog box or something


I'm sorry I couldn't do too much but I would love a technical discussion. I really want to know what was not alright in some parts of the app.
